# House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to the "House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques" competition on Kaggle. The objective is to predict the sale prices of homes in Ames, Iowa, using a comprehensive dataset with 79 explanatory variables. This competition is perfect for data science enthusiasts who have some experience with R or Python and are looking to improve their machine learning skills.

## Competition Description

The dataset includes various features of residential homes, such as the number of bedrooms, basement ceiling height, proximity to railroads, and more. Participants are challenged to use creative feature engineering and advanced regression techniques like random forests and gradient boosting to predict the final sale prices accurately.

## Evaluation

The competition is evaluated based on the Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) between the logarithm of the predicted sale price and the logarithm of the observed sale price. This ensures that errors in predicting expensive and cheap houses affect the result equally.

## Repository Structure

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/house-prices-regression.git
cd house-prices-regression
```

## 1.Install Dependencies
